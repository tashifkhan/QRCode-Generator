#### Note for macOS Users

macOS may apply quarantine attributes to downloaded applications. If you encounter security warnings when trying to run the application, you have two options:

1. **Remove quarantine attribute using Terminal**:

   ```bash
   xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/qrcode-generator-gui
   xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/qrcode-generator-cli
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/` with the actual path to the extracted executables.

2. **Using GUI**:
   - Right-click (or Control+click) on the application
   - Select "Open" from the context menu
   - When the security warning appears, click "Open"
   - The application will be saved as an exception to your security settings

### From Source

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tashifkhan/QRCode-Generator.git
cd QRCode-Generator
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Using PyInstaller (Packaged Executables)

#### Build Executables

1. Install PyInstaller:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

2. Build GUI Application:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --add-data "web:web" app.py
```

3. Build CLI Application:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile main.py
```

The executables will be available in the `dist` directory.

## Usage

### GUI Application

1. Run from source:

```bash
python app.py
```

2. Or use the packaged executable:
   - Windows: Run `app.exe`
   - macOS/Linux: Run `./app`

Upon launching the web interface you'll see two options:

- **URL/Text QR**: Enter a URL or text to generate a QR code.
- **UPI QR**: Enter your UPI ID, display name, and optionally set an amount to generate a UPI payment QR code.
  - **History Feature**: Previously used UPI details are automatically saved and can be quickly reused from the dropdown history
  - **Smart Suggestions**: Access up to 10 recent UPI configurations with one click
  - **Privacy**: All history stored locally on your device

### CLI Application

1. Run from source:

```bash
python main.py [URL] [-s SAVE_PATH] [-d]
```

For UPI QR code generation, run:

```bash
python main.py -upi
```

2. Or use the packaged executable:

```bash
./main [URL] [-s SAVE_PATH] [-d]
```

Options:

- `URL`: The URL or text to encode (required for URL/Text QR).
- `-upi, --upi`: Generate a UPI QR code (or use interactive prompts if no value is provided).
- `-s, --save`: Save the QR code to a file (optional, defaults to qr_code.png).
- `-d, --display`: Display the QR code.

Examples:

```bash
# Generate and display a URL QR code
python main.py https://tashif.codes -d

# Generate and save a URL QR code
python main.py https://tashif.codes -s "/Users/taf/Desktop/My Website QR Code.png"

# Generate a UPI QR code interactively
python main.py -upi
```

## Technologies

### Progressive Web App (PWA)

The web version implements modern PWA standards for native app-like experience:

- **Service Worker**: Advanced caching strategy with cache-first for static assets and network-first for dynamic content
- **Web App Manifest**: Proper PWA metadata for installation and theming
- **Offline-First Architecture**: Complete functionality without internet after initial load
- **Background Sync**: Automatic updates with user notification system
- **Local Storage**: Persistent UPI history and user preferences using browser storage
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive interface for all screen sizes and orientations

### Eel

This project uses [Eel](https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Eel), a Python library for creating simple Electron-like offline HTML/JS GUI applications. Eel hosts a local web server and allows for:

- Bidirectional communication between Python backend and JavaScript frontend
- Native GUI capabilities using web technologies
- Easy deployment as a standalone desktop application

### Pyodide

[Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) is used as a fallback mechanism when the Eel backend is not available (such as when running in browsers without the Python backend). It:

- Brings the Python runtime to the browser via WebAssembly
- Allows Python code execution directly in the browser
- Enables generation of QR codes on the client side when accessing the web version
- Provides seamless functionality between desktop application and web version
- **Cached Offline**: Complete Pyodide runtime and required packages cached for offline use

### UPI History & Caching

The application implements intelligent caching for user convenience:

- **Local Storage**: UPI payment details stored securely in browser's local storage
- **History Management**: Automatically saves up to 10 most recent UPI configurations
- **Quick Access**: Dropdown history for instant reuse of previous UPI details
- **Privacy First**: All data stored locally on device, never transmitted to servers
- **Cross-Session**: History persists across browser sessions and app restarts

This dual approach (Eel + Pyodide fallback) with PWA capabilities ensures that the QR code generator works as a desktop application, web application, and installable PWA with full offline functionality.
